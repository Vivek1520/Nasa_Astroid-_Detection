The classification of asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous is a critical task in planetary defense,
especially with the increasing discovery of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). This study explores the
application of machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoost, to classify asteroids based on
their potential threat. The dataset of records 99500 is analyzed using feature extraction methods, and
models are trained to improve classification accuracy . Our results show that ensemble methods,
particularly XGBoost, achieved the highest accuracy of RF 99%, offering robust prediction capabilities
for classifying dangerous asteroids.
